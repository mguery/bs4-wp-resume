    <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
    <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In
      the winter, I am an avid skiier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months
      here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and
      television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free
      time exploring the latest technolgy advancements in the front-end web development
      world.</p>
